PROPERTY-BINDING:
1.To make an functionality dynamic we keep properties inside angular braces.
  
    [property]="expression"
	
**Each HTMl element we use is parsed by the browser and kind of translated into
  DOM and each element in DOM has couple of properties a lot of these can't even
  be set through attributes on HTML element.
**One of the main reasons we use Angular is that it can easily update dynamically

We are binding native element property to our typescript property===>PROPERTY BINDING!

    [native element property] = " Typescript propety(customized)"

2.Once done with property binding and we want to output our binded functionality we simply make string interpolate
  Instead of using string interpolation we are using property binding here

  innerText property of an element is what just between the opening and closing tag
