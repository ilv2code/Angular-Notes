DEBUGGING:
***Typescript is not which runs in the browser, 
   then how can we access typescript?????
 so javascript bundles are used--as
 javascript files support SOURCEMAPS(debugger source maps)( these are little 
 addition to CLI which adds to our bundles which allowed browse to translate our 
 javascript code to typescript or simply to map between these two)
 
 
 3ways to debug angular code:
 1.READING the ERROR message
 2.using SOURCEMAPS to debug
 3.using AUGURY to understand the application and dependencies
