EVENT BINDING:
**this comunication happens from template to logic(ts)/component class...
1.We want our data to listen on particular events
2.the logic(method) which we are writing inside our ts will get triggred from our template
3.For event binding we use banana braces ()
4.(event)="business logic(method)"
  **on this particular event this method supposed to be executed
5.template referance or local referance is something that holds the total input 
  from input field
   
   <input type="text" #referanceName>
   <button class="btn btn-primary" (click)="methodName(referanceName)">Add</button>
   
   $event holds each and every character of input field,one character at time
   
   <input type="text" (input)="methodName($event)">
   
6.What ever the input we enter into input field will get stored inside
  
  event.target.value
  
7.$event is a kind of varible name in template when using event binding
data emitted with that event

**input and click are DOM events and they shift data when an event triggred

 we pass this $event as argument to the method we are calling
