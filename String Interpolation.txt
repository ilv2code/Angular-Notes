DATA BINDING--INTERPOLATION:
1.Dynamic way of outplacing(output) data
2.Communication between Typescript code(business code) and template and vice versa.
3.two ways:
          string interpolation ---> {{}}
		  property binding--->(property)=>"data"
 **template is the thing user interacts 

4.when clicking a button we want something to be triggred inside our ts code(then
	getting other direction means a template to typescript code(business code)
	 
	 one way:
	        Event Binding --->(event)="expression"
5.We can combined both directions 
		Two-Way-Binding:
		           [(ngModel)]="data"	
6.String Interpolation:
        {{typescript expression}}
		example :
		{{title}}
		  typescript expression can be a property
		  
		  **we can call a method which in turn returns a string 
		  {{methodName()}}
		  **we cannot write multi line expressions here or blocking code
		    like if , for and like control ....
